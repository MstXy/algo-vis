# algo-vis
 d3.js visualizations of extendible hashing, linear hashing and bloom filters.

Works done during Fall 2021 together with [Jun Ooi](https://github.com/dweggyness) @dweggyness, as a research assistant at [Human-Data Interaction Lab](https://huda-lab.github.io/), NYU Abu Dhabi.


### Project Live Demonstration: [https://mstxy.github.io/algo-vis/]

This visualization uses JavaScript for algorithm implementations and d3.js for the visualizations.

All the visualizations are interactive and you are welcomed to explore!
